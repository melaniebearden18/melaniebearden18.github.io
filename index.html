        <h1>Melanie Bearden</h1>
        <h2>Full Stack Developer</h2>

        <p>I'm a process-oriented individual who thrives on helping companies streamline their operations, reduce costs, and increase efficiency. I love working on projects that involve lots of moving parts and keeping track of many different things at once—and seeing how they all come together in the end. I have over 4 years of experience working with customer service, data analytics, and operations management.</p>
        <p>Add another paragraph if needed.</p>
